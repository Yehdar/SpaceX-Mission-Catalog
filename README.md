# SpaceX Mission Catalog
## Abstract
My take on the SpaceX API with GraphQL

### Technologies Used
JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Apollo, Axios, SpaceX API, ExpressJS, NodeJs

<hr> 

## Notes
### Correct Package Manager
Use yarn over npm as the package manager to install the tools (GraphQL, Axios, Express, etc) because npm repeatedly failed to download the packages. 

### graphql-http
Express-graphql is depracated lol. So instead we use graphql-http.
